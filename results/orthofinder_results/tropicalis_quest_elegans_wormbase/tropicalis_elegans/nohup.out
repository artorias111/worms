Writing orthogroups to file
---------------------------
OrthoFinder assigned 85230 genes (92.9% of total) to 20460 orthogroups. Fifty percent of all genes were in orthogroups with 4 or more genes (G50 was 4) and were contained in the largest 6924 orthogroups (O50 was 6924). There were 13925 orthogroups with all species present and 923 of these consisted entirely of single-copy genes.

2021-12-02 13:08:29 : Done orthogroups
